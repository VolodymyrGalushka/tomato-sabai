Using DNSCrypt on Windows
=========================

On Windows, `dnscrypt-proxy` can be started from the command-line the same way
as on other operating systems.

Alternatively, it can run as a Windows Service.

Quickstart
----------

1) Download and extract the latest
[Windows package for dnscrypt](http://dnscrypt.org)

2) Copy the `dnscrypt-proxy.exe` file to any location, as well as the
`libsodium-4.dll` file. Both should be in the same location. If you
are using plugins depending on ldns, copy the ldns DLL as well.

3) Open a terminal (run `cmd.exe`) and type (you may need to specify
the full path to the file):

    dnscrypt-proxy.exe --install

4) Change your DNS settings to `127.0.0.1`

Congratulations, you're now using DNSCrypt.

Advanced usage
--------------

The Windows build of `dnscrypt-proxy` adds the following command-line
options:

- `--install`: install the proxy as a service.
- `--reinstall`: ditto.
- `--uninstall`: uninstall the service.

Startup options should specified as subkeys from this registry key:
`HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\dnscrypt-proxy\Parameters`

The service is named `dnscrypt-proxy`.

The following subkeys are recognized and should be self-explanatory:

    Plugins           (REG_MULTI_SZ)
    LocalAddress      (REG_SZ)
    ProviderKey       (REG_SZ)
    ProviderName      (REG_SZ)
    ResolverAddress   (REG_SZ)
    EDNSPayloadSize   (DWORD)
    MaxActiveRequests (DWORD)
    TCPOnly           (DWORD)

For example, in order to listen to local address `127.0.0.7` instead
of `127.0.0.1`, the string value `127.0.0.7` should be set for the key
`HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\dnscrypt-proxy\Parameters\LocalAddress`.

Plugins should be listed as full paths to .DLL files, optionally
followed by a coma and plugin-specific arguments.

The service should be restarted after the registry has been updated.
